# Pre-work - Tippy

Tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Alexander Brown

Time spent: 24 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1**: "What are your reactions to the iOS app development platform so far? How would you describe outlets and actions to another developer? Bonus: any idea how they are being implemented under the hood? (It might give you some ideas if you right-click on the Storyboard and click Open As->Source Code")

The integrated editor, debugger, storyboard, on-line documentation is a good IDE.  Outlets are used to pass data back and forth to your code (set and retrieve data).  Actions call methods which are executed in response to a users action (i.e. clicking on a button).

Question 2: "Swift uses [Automatic Reference Counting](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH20-ID49) (ARC), which is not a garbage collector, to manage memory. Can you explain how you can get a strong reference cycle for closures? (There's a section explaining this concept in the link, how would you summarize as simply as possible?)"

There can be a case where two class instances have a strong reference to each other.  In this case the instances can never be deallocated due to the dependency.  To solve this one solution is using a weak reference, the instance is set to nil when deallocated.  The other solution is to use an unowned reference, when the other instance has the same or longer lifetime.  It is required that the unowned reference must always have a value.
